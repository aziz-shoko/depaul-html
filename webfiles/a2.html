            Take out the grip and put it on top of a flat surface as shown in the picture above.

            Open up the strap and look for the metal piece. If the metal piece is towards the left of the grip, then the grip goes on the left hand and vise versa for the right grip. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="step-three">
        <h2>Step Three</h2>

            Put the grips on in a way that your palm is against the leather part of the grip. This will help to protect your skin when you are swinging on the bar.

        <p>
            The grip holes should stay on top of your fingers. Do not slide your fingers down!

            Finally, really tighten the strap across your wrists and your are ready to go!
